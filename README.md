START PROJECT:
command: "npm start" or "npx start". "expo start" also works.
stop server: "ctrl + c"
reload app command: "r"
open iphone simulator in mac command: "i"
debug in physical iphone: 1- download expo app and make sure you are connected to same api address.

NOTE: download npm and/or expo if not installed. 

UPDATING MODULES:
when updating expo use this command: expo update.

When updating expo or react native this problem might come up: "Unable to find expo in this project - have you run yarn / npm install yet?"
A) - cannot find expo. Maybe it's deleted and needs to re-install
1- npm i -g expo-cli
2- npm audit fix â€“-force
B) - when udpating react-native or other package updated inside npm.
(it deletes packege-lock.json and module files, but when re-installing if there's conflicts it will stop installing files again.) use:
1-npm install --force // it will ignore the conflicts and install packege-lock.json and module files again
